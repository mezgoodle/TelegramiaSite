# Welcome to Telegramia!

## Overview

Telegramia - is the text-based game in [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Shortly, it's just a _bot_, that interects with the user.

## History

A long time ago I have seen some games in Telegram and it interested me. Also I like [Warcraft](https://telegram.org/), MMORPG. So I combined telegram game and RPG genre. At first it was a big one file, close to 600 lines of code. Then I founded this [template](https://github.com/Latand/aiogram-bot-template). But this _template_ is bad and outdated, and moved to [another](https://github.com/Latand/tgbot_template). After that I have started to test my bot and improve the architecture.

## Telegramia group

When I have started to develop the bot, some ideas have comed to me. I have also some knowledges in another areas, such as _web development_ and _data analysis_. And I created more projects, related to the **Telegramia**.
