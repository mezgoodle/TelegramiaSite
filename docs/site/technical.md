# Technical details

## Libraries

The site is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with the library [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The source
code is available [here](https://github.com/mezgoodle/TelegramiaSite). The site is hosted on _GitHub Pages_. The library
is the best to make static site with Markdown syntax. Also I have added
the [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
