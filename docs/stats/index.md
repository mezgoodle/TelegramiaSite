# TelegramiaStats

## Overview

On the second course in the university, I started to learn about the data analysis and visualization. I realized that I
could use the data from the Telegramia. For some users it can be useful or just interesting to see, for example, which raid is the most popular.

## Technical details

More about technical details read [here](technical.md).
