Registration Step 1: To register, you need to send a message to the bot with the command /create. You will receive a message with a keyboard with the country options. Step 2: Write your game nickname. Step 3: Choose class for your character. Step 4: Accept if you agree with your character. If you don't agree with your character, you can change it. Summary: After the registration, you will receive a message with information about the city where you are located. You can delete your account at any time by sending a message to the bot with the command /delete. City You can visit any city object by clicking the buttons in the keyboard. There you can increase your level, stats, buy items. Example Visiting the market: Roads Roads are the main way to go to other cities or objects. It takes your energy to travel, which you can restore in the tavern. Example Characteristics There are four characteristics of your character: strength, agility, intelligence and intuition. As you can see on the image: They are based on the class you have chosen and have limits on your level. You can increase your characteristics by visiting different objects. Example Increase your intelligence: Mounts These horses are the main means of transportation. You can ride them to go to other cities or objects. In game logic, you spend less energy to travel. You can buy them in the menagerie. Example Dungeons This is the place where you can find the monsters. You can fight them and get rewards. Here you can get the information about the dungeon, the rewards, the damage and how much time it needs to be completed. After entering the dungeon, you need to wait the time to complete it. While you are in the dungeon, you cannot travel. Raids Raids are similar to dungeons, but they are more difficult, because they have more levels to complete. Here you can also get the information about the raid, the rewards, the damage and how much time it needs to be completed. You can also get the information about the next raid level at any time.

The source code is available here . I used the template for my project structure. It's increased the readability and it's easier to maintain. All functions are documented and the code is well commented. When I had a single file, even in Visual Studio Code it was hard to read. But now everything is in their folders and bot works faster. For interactions with the database I used motor . It's a great library for working with databases. It's a good choice for a project with a lot of data.
